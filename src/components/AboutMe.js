      <p className='about-me-p'>
        I'm an impact-driven, dedicated and socially conscious professional,
        passionate about driving positive change to my organization and the
        world. As a fullstack software engineer, I am JavaScript and Ruby focused,
        with an aptitude for learning new technologies. Have a problem you're
        working on? Connect with me, I'd love to help you solve it.
      </p>
      <p className='about-me-p'>
        Previously, I helped veterans figure out what to do in their post-military
        career through American Corporate Partners, I planned public events for
        Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy, and I started my career building a youth
        camp at a horse barn. I'm adventurous, experimental, and curious to find
        new solutions for old problems. I hold a Bachelor's in Human Rights,
        Politics and Development from NYU, and am conversational in Spanish.
